    "Moving a chip means sliding it diagonally in the forward direction only except when taking an opponent's chip or if a 'dama’ chip takes an opponent's chip.",
  
    "The two players alternately take turns in moving a chip(a pass is not allowed). + A player who touches a chip {touch move’) is required to move unless it ts not possible to do so. After each ‘move’, a player has to record his or her ‘move’ in a scoresheet (only one scoresheet will be used by the two players).",
  
    "Each player is allotted one minute per ‘move’ including the recording of the 'move’ and the corresponding score in the scoresheet. In as much as taking a chip or chips 1s mandatory, then the one-minute per ‘move’ does not apply in this situation. In taking an opponent's chip. the taker’ chip jumps over the ‘taken’ chip and uses any of the four operation symbols of +, -_ x, and -:- where the taker chip lands.",
  
    `A chip is declared ‘dama’ if’ it stops in any of the following squares of the opposing player: (1.0) (3.0) (5.0) (7.0) Similarly the opposing player's chip is declared 'dama’  if it stops in any of the following squares: (0.7) (2.7){4.7) (6.7) - A 'dama’ chip can slide diagonally forward or backward in any unoccupied square as long as no opponent's chip blocks its path. It could take a chip or chips whereby its corresponding sum. difference, product or quotient 1s doubled. Sunilarly if an ordinary chip takes an opponent's 'dama’ chip, its score 1s also doubled. Correspondingly, if a 'dama’ chip takes an opponent's ‘dama’ chip. then its score 1s quadrupled - A taker’ chip can take one chip or more than one chips with the required option to take the greater number of chips. - Between "a
  'dama’ chip taking an opponent's chip” and "a chip taking an opponent's chip”, the former prevails. - A taker’ or taken dama’ chip should be identified by encircling it in the scoresheet.`,
  
  "The game ends if the 20-minute game period lapsed: - the moves are repetitive: © a player has no more chips to move: - an opponent's chip 1s ‘cornered’",
  
  "The remaining chip or chips of the players are to be added to their respective scores. If the remaining chip is a 'dama’. then its score 1s also doubled.",
  
  "The player with the greater accumulated total score wins the game."
